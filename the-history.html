          Treaty No. 1 was signed with the understanding that it would last "as

          Indigenous peoples have lived on Canada for thousands of years, with

          institutions.

          The community needed a treaty <span>(Treaty 1)</span> because the
          Canadian government was trying to acquire legal control over
          territories that were being held at the time by different Native
          communities living in Manitoba.
        </p>
        <p>
          Treaty 1 was also used as a supposed act of good will and peace
          between Natives at the Canadian government.

      <h2>Historic Terms</h2>
      <p>
        Lands set aside for settlers and Indigenous peoples were designated
        through treaties; <span>160 acres of land</span> for each family of five
        or in like proportions for a smaller or larger family. Promises were
        made to build schools for every community, to pay each "Indian" a meagre
        annuity of <span>$3 to $5</span>, and to provide some chosen Chiefs,
        headmen, and council members with commodities like twine, ploughs,
        boars, and oxen.
      </p>

      <h2>The Reality</h2>
      <p>
        If you were to read only the federal government's treaty documents, you
        might get the impression that First Nations were only allowed to
        continue existing on the lands set aside for them because of the
        kindness and goodwill of the British Crown and settlers and that Native
        Americans were to be feared and needed to be subdued. The then-Chiefs,
        however, had a different meaning of the treaties when they signed the
        papers, as you find out when you talk to Elders and other knowledge
        keepers about that time.
