        <p>
          A treaty is an agreement between the Canadian government, indigenous
          communities, provinces, and territories.
        </p>
        <p>
          TreatiesÂ outline each group's continued treaty rights and benefits and
          set forth the parties' ongoing rights and obligations.
        </p>
        <p>In other words, a treaty is an understanding between nations.</p>

        Treaty No. 1 was <span>signed August 3rd, 1871</span>, by

      <h2>Relationship Between Treaty 1 and Other Treaties</h2>
      <p>
        <!-- Spans are added to emphasize and style important words.-->
        A <span>total of 11 numbered treaties</span> were negotiated. The
        treaties together make up an integral part of Canada's historical and
        contemporary landscape. The general form and scope of agreements of the
        treaties are similar, however the circumstances of each treaty signing
        is unique. The treaties (negotiated between 1899 and 1921) are all
        relatively similar but treaty 1 holds fewer clauses.
