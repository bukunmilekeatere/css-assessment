      <h2>Relationship Between Treaty 1 and Other Treaties</h2>
      <p>
        <!-- Spans are added to emphasize and style important words.-->
        All the treaties together make up an integral part of Canada's
        historical and contemporary landscape. A
        <span>total of 11 numbered treaties</span>
        were negotiated. The general form and scope of agreements of the
        treaties are similar, however the circumstances of each treaty signing
        is unique. The treaties negotiated between 1899 and 1921 are all
        relatively similar but treaty 1 holds fewer clauses.
