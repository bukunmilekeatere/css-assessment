        <h2>The Difference of Treaty 1</h2>
        <p>
          Treaty 1 is the first post-Confederation treaty and covered Manitoba
          as it existed then.

        <p>
          <!-- Spans are added to emphasize and style important words.-->
          Treaty 1 is different from the other treaties because the First Nation
          included in Treaty 1 have their own languages, culture, social
          structure, legal system and political system. The
          <span>clear diversity</span> among the peoples of the treaties is one
          main reason Treaty 1 is different from Treaty 2 to 11.
        </p>

        <p>
          <!-- Spans are added to emphasize and style important words.-->
          Another difference between the treaties is the area ceded.
          <span>
            Sixteen thousand, seven hundred square miles

            (43,252.8km<sup>2</sup>)
          </span>
          of land in south-central Manitoba was transferred to the Crown in
          Treaty 1.
        </p>

        <p>
          <!-- Spans are added to emphasize and style important words.-->
          The signing gifts are another thing that differentiates Treaty 1 from
          the other treaties. As a result of good conduct of the Indegenous
          peoples, the Crown gave a present of <span>three dollars</span> for
          each man, woman, and child belonging to the bands represented in
          Treaty 1.

          <span>Naawi-Oodena</span> officially converted to joint reserve lands

        </p>
        <p>
          To conclude negotiations spanning the course of two decades, lands of
          the former Kapyong Barracks in Winnipeg, MB, were officially converted
          to reserve and repatriated to the Joint Reserve land base of the seven
          Treaty One First Nations on December 16, 2022.

          Naawi-Oodena means “<span>Centre of the Heart and Community</span>” in
          the Anishinaabemowin language. Its development will result in the
          mutual benefits of jobs, income, and profits not only for citizens and
          businesses of Turtle Island’s First Nations, but those of Winnipeg and
          surrounding areas. Revenues will flow to respective coffers that
          contribute to both the City of Winnipeg and First Nation governments
          as services, infrastructure, and programs are developed on
          Naawi-Oodena.

          – Today, Treaty One Nation Chiefs and representatives from the Federal
          Government, the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs, and the Southern Chiefs’
          Organization gathered at Lower Fort Garry National Historic Site to
          mark the 151st commemoration of the signing of Treaty No. 1. To
          commemorate this important date in a special way, delegates celebrated
          by sharing in a Pipe and Water Ceremony while a Sacred Fire remained
          lit at Gabeshiwin, the site’s camp area.

          Opening ceremonies were followed by remarks from the Treaty One Nation
          Knowledge Keepers Council on the history of Treaty No. 1 and followed
          by a feast. The Knowledge Keeper’s Council is composed of Elders from
          each of the seven Treaty No. 1 First Nations who guide all Treaty One
          Nation governing decisions. To honour our relationship today as a
          result of the Treaty, Elders shared that it is a time for all pray for
          ongoing reconciliation and offer prayers for good relations as were
          intended from the signing 151 years ago.

          “151 years ago on this day, and after seven days of negotiations with
          our Treaty Partners, a significant agreement was made that still
          stands today. We welcomed settlement onto our lands and shared in the
          abundance of our resources. The Treaty One Nations are still here,
          just as we were 151 years ago. Our relationship is the foundation of
          the Treaty, and this relationship continues to evolve into what it was
          intended to be – Nation to Nation. Last week, Treaty One signed an
          agreement with the City of Winnipeg that solidifies our commitments to
          one another in sharing and benefitting from these lands. These new
          agreements, 151 years later, are starting to reflect the spirit and
          intent of Treaty One. It is my hope that we continue to set the
          standard for what our future can look like for all of our Treaty
          people. I would like to honour and acknowledge the significance of
          this day that brought us all to where we stand today. Miigwetch.”
